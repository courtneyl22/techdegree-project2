Pagination & List Filtering

With this project, we were required to take a list of students and break the list down into pages. We were also given the opportunity  

Technologies used: 
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

Here are the grading requirements:

No snippets, plugins or libraries
- Project contains only plain "vanilla" JavaScript and doesn't rely on jQuery, some other library, or any code snippets or plugins.

Progressive enhancement & unobtrusive JavaScript
- No inline JavaScript. All JS is linked from an external file.
- Uses unobtrusive JavaScript to append markup for the pagination links. So none of the pagination link's markup is added into the HTML.
- Uses unobtrusive JavaScript to append HTML for a search bar.

Pagination Links
- Pagination links are created. If there are 44 students, 5 links should be generated, if there’s 66 students, 7 links should be generated. Etc.
- Pagination links display based on how many search results are returned. For example: if 10 or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination links are displayed. If 22 search results are returned, 3 pagination links are displayed.

Paging
- The first 10 students are shown when the page loads, and each pagination link displays the correct students.
- Clicking on “1” in the pagination links should show students 1 to 10. Clicking “2” shows 11 to 20. Clicking “5” shows students 41 to 50, and so on.
- When a search yields 0 results, a message is displayed on the page, informing the user that no results have been found.

Code Comments
- Code comments have been added explaining how the functions work.
